# CS150_DGL_CallGraphClassification

Final project for the course CS150-02: Deep Graph Learning @Tufts University, 2023 Spring.

Workflow:
- Ground truth: given two call graphs, calculate the *directed graph editing distance*
- Experiments: split dataset, train, and test:
    - for 2 input <G1, G2>, loss = dist(embedding,
    - obtain an optimal model with an accuracy score
